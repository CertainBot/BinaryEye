# Binary Eye

![Travis-ci](https://api.travis-ci.org/markusfisch/BinaryEye.svg)

Yet another barcode scanner for Android. As if there weren't [enough][play].

This one is totally free, open source and does use the [ZXing][zxing] barcode
scanning library.

Unlike many others it works in portrait and landscape orientation, can read
inverted codes, uses Material Design and doesn't do anything else but decoding
a barcode.

And it's written in [Kotlin][kotlin] because I've wanted to explore that a
bit more.
